This folder contains the 6 canonical HTML email templates:

1. `welcome-account-created.html`
2. `email-confirmation.html`
3. `youve-been-invited.html`
4. `invite-accepted-admin.html`

## Notes

- Keep legal footer line consistent:
  - `Cash handoff documentation only. Not a tax or accounting tool.`
  - ` SpendNote • spendnote.app`
- Keep button labels explicit and action-driven.
- Avoid marketing claims or fake social proof in transactional emails.
