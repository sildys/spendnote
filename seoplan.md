# SEO + ICP Plan (v1)

## Positioning guardrail (must keep)
SpendNote is **not** an accounting, tax invoicing, or POS replacement tool.
SpendNote is for **internal cash control**, **handoff proof**, and **team audit trail**.

## Target Segment Table (ICP v2)

| Priority | Segment | Typical profile | Main pain (non-accounting) | SpendNote value | Willingness to pay (hypothesis) | Main channel |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Shared-cash small teams | 3-20 people, multiple users handling cash | Unclear who recorded what; disputes later | Internal cash logs + receipt proof + audit trail | Medium-High | Direct outreach + referrals |
| 2 | Shift-handover heavy teams | Daily shift change operations | No reliable handover proof | Timestamped handoff tracking | Medium | Local owner groups + communities |
| 3 | Multi-cash-box operators | 2+ locations or multiple internal cash boxes | Weak visibility per cash box | Cash-box-level tracking + accountability | Medium | SEO landing + demo CTA |
| 4 | Field/onsite cash teams | Service/onsite operations | Paper-based records, hard to trace | Fast internal proof with central history | Medium | Direct DM/email + partner intros |

### Excluded segments (for now)
- Users looking for POS/cash register replacement.
- Users looking for full accounting/ERP replacement.
- Enterprise procurement-first orgs.

### Key notes per page (important details)

1. **index (`/`)**
   - Canonical is correct (`https://spendnote.app/`).
   - Already indexable.
   - Uses SoftwareApplication structured data.

3. **faq (`/faq`)**
   - Indexable and has clean canonical.
   - Uses FAQPage structured data (important for search visibility).

4. **template/generator/landing pages (`/petty-cash-*`, `/cash-handoff-receipt`, `/cash-receipt-book`, `/small-business-cash-receipt`, `/carbonless-receipt-book-alternative`)**
   - All currently `noindex, nofollow` by intent (draft-stage indexing gate).
   - Canonicals are properly set to clean URLs.
   - Most use Article or SoftwareApplication schema.
   - Copy needs consistency pass to keep non-accounting positioning.

### Finish checklist for these SEO pages

1. Normalize positioning language:
   - internal cash control,
   - handoff proof,
   - team accountability,
   - explicit “not POS/accounting replacement” where relevant.
2. Resolve indexability mismatch:
   - keep `noindex` during draft stage,
   - switch eligible pages to `index, follow` only when content is finalized.
3. Refresh per-page metadata:
   - title uniqueness,
   - intent-matched meta description,
   - consistent OG/Twitter summary.
4. Strengthen internal links:
   - cross-link between related SEO pages + pricing + FAQ + signup CTA.
5. Re-submit for indexing after updates:
   - URL inspection + request indexing in Search Console.
