# SEO + ICP Plan (v1)

## Positioning guardrail (must keep)
SpendNote is **not** an accounting, tax invoicing, or POS replacement tool.
SpendNote is for **internal cash control**, **handoff proof**, and **team audit trail**.

## SEO Quality Rules (must follow for every page)

**1. Keyword cannibalization prevention**
- Before creating a new page, check if an existing page already covers the same search intent.
- If yes → **expand the existing page** (add H2, FAQ entry, alt text variants) instead of creating a new page.
- One search intent = one page. Two pages targeting the same intent will hurt both.
- "Receipt for X" keyword variants should be woven into existing service provider pages, NOT separate pages (e.g. "receipt for babysitting" → `babysitter-cash-payment-receipt.html`).
- "Cash slip" is a synonym for "cash receipt" — only create a separate page if the target market/context is genuinely different (e.g. UK-specific content). Otherwise, add "cash slip" as a keyword variant to the existing cash receipt page.

**2. Meta description length (Bing compliance)**
- `<meta name="description">` must be **≤ 160 characters** to avoid Bing Webmaster Tools warnings.
- `og:description` and `twitter:description` should also stay ≤ 160 characters.
- Title tags: aim for **≤ 60 characters** where possible.

#### Strategic SEO Priorities (near-term)

> These themes should be pursued as soon as possible — they represent high-potential angles that can bring in new segments quickly.

**1. "Cash slip" keyword cluster**
- "Cash slip" is a widely used synonym for cash receipt in many markets (UK, Australia, South Africa, India).
- Target keywords: `cash slip template`, `cash slip generator`, `printable cash slip`, `cash payment slip`.
- This is low-hanging fruit — same product, different keyword family.
- Potential pages: `cash-slip-template.html`, `printable-cash-slip.html`.

**2. Excel replacement / spreadsheet alternative angle**
- Many target users currently track cash in Excel or Google Sheets — positioning SpendNote as the upgrade.
- Target keywords: `cash tracking spreadsheet alternative`, `replace excel cash log`, `petty cash excel alternative`.
- This angle works across ALL segments (small teams, shift teams, treasurers).
- Potential pages: `petty-cash-excel-alternative.html`, `cash-tracking-spreadsheet-replacement.html`.

**3. "Receipt for [X]" keyword pattern (ChatGPT tip)**
- The compound pattern `receipt for [service/scenario]` is a natural Google search pattern with massive long-tail potential.
- Examples: `receipt for babysitting`, `receipt for tutoring`, `receipt for cleaning services`, `receipt for cash payment`, `receipt for dog walking`, `receipt for lawn care`.
- Every existing service provider page can be supplemented with a "receipt for X" variant or the pages can target both patterns.
- This pattern scales infinitely — every cash-paid service has a "receipt for [X]" search.

| Keyword variant | Target existing page |
|---|---|
| printable cash receipt, cash receipt printable | `cash-receipt-template.html` |
| petty cash form pdf, petty cash voucher pdf | `petty-cash-voucher-template.html` |

| ~~missing-petty-cash-receipts-tax~~ | Tax legal risk |
| ~~restaurant-petty-cash-tips~~ | IRS tip reporting regulations |
| ~~restaurant-cash-tracking~~ | POS/cash register regulatory overlap |
| ~~shift-cash-handover-log~~ | Cannibalization with `cash-handoff-receipt` |
| ~~petty-cash-sign-out-sheet~~ | Cannibalization with `petty-cash-voucher-template` |
| ~~replace-petty-cash-spreadsheet~~ | Merged into `petty-cash-app-vs-excel` |

---

#### Future Phase: Multilingual SEO Expansion

> **Key insight:** SpendNote receipts are already fully localizable — custom receipt labels (Pro) + currency selection mean the generated receipt works in ANY language/country. Only the app UI stays English, but the app is simple enough (few screens, few buttons) that non-English speakers can use it easily while their clients receive receipts in their local language.

**Strategy:** Take the best-performing 20-30 English SEO pages and create localized versions in target languages using subfolder structure (`/es/`, `/de/`, `/pt/`, `/fr/`).

**Target markets (priority order):**
1. **Spanish** (`/es/`) — US Hispanic market + Latin America. Massive cash-heavy economy, millions of small tradesmen.
2. **Portuguese** (`/pt/`) — Brazil. Cash-intensive small business sector.
3. **German** (`/de/`) — DACH region. Surprisingly high cash usage, strong documentation culture.
4. **French** (`/fr/`) — France + West Africa. Small tradesmen, community funds.

**Why this works:**
- Receipt output is already localized (labels + currency) → the product delivers in the user's language.
- Same content structure as English pages → only text and keywords change.
- Subfolder SEO (`spendnote.app/es/recibo-de-efectivo`) is a proven multilingual strategy.
- Much lower keyword competition in non-English markets for cash receipt tools.
- Multiplier effect: 30 pages × 4 languages = 120 additional SEO pages with minimal effort.

**Timing:** Only after English SEO is established and generating stable traffic (earliest: 6-12 months after English content launch).

### Core Pages (Non-SEO Landing)

| URL | Source file | Current robots | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| https://spendnote.app/ | `index.html` | `index, follow` | Main product page (brand + core value) |
| https://spendnote.app/pricing | `spendnote-pricing.html` | `noindex, nofollow` | Plan comparison / conversion page |
| https://spendnote.app/faq | `spendnote-faq.html` | `index, follow` | Objection handling + product clarification |

3. **faq (`/faq`)**
   - Indexable and has clean canonical.

### Finish checklist for these SEO pages

### Update log - 2026-03-06 (batch 2)

1. **Created 6 new SEO draft pages (noindex, nofollow):**
   - `handyman-cash-payment-receipt.html` — service provider segment, reuses contractor images
   - `tutor-cash-payment-receipt.html` — service provider segment, reuses babysitter images
   - `employee-cash-advance-receipt.html` — employer/HR segment, reuses contractor images
   - `school-money-collection-tracker.html` — community/group segment, reuses generic dashboard images
   - `cash-deposit-receipt.html` — landlord/vendor segment, reuses generic receipt images
   - `custom-cash-receipt-with-logo.html` — feature-focused page, reuses contractor + generic images

2. **Cannibalization check:**
   - Each page targets a distinct search intent not covered by existing pages.
   - handyman ≠ contractor (different service, different client type)
   - tutor ≠ babysitter (different service, different payment context)
   - employee advance ≠ contractor advance (internal vs external, payroll vs project)
   - school collection ≠ event cash handling (ongoing collection vs one-time event)
   - deposit receipt ≠ payment receipt (refundable deposit vs service payment)
   - custom logo receipt ≠ receipt template (branding feature vs general template)

3. **All 6 pages include:**
   - Article + FAQPage structured data
   - 4 unique FAQ items each
   - Meta description ≤ 160 characters
   - Title ≤ 60 characters
   - Disclaimer box (not invoice/tax/accounting)
   - Internal links to related (but different) existing pages
   - Unique footer SVG gradient IDs to avoid conflicts

4. **Draft page count updated:** 1 → 7

**KPI:** 2 core URLs submitted for indexing.

### Day 2 - Choose 2 launch SEO pages

4. Keep ImageObject schema as support signal.
5. Add image sitemap entries if available.

**KPI:** 3+ crawlable, indexable sample image URLs.

**KPI:** at least 3 external mentions/links.

### Day 7 - Measure and adjust
1. Review Search Console performance:
   - queries,

   - average position,
   - clicks.
2. Tune titles/meta on top pages based on real queries.
3. Choose one page to double down next week.

**KPI target for week 1:**
