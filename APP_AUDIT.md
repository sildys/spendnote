| **Hosting** | Cloudflare Pages (spendnote.app) |
| **Monitoring** | Sentry (consent-gated), client_error_logs table |
| **Session** | sessionStorage-based (tab-scoped), bootstrap for receipt tabs |

---

## 2. Pages & Navigation

### 2.1 Public Pages (no auth required)

These support `?publicToken=`, `?demo=1`, and `?bootstrap=1` for iframe/tab session sharing.

---

## 3. Authentication & Session

### 3.1 Auth Flows
| Flow | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Sign Up** | `auth.signUp()` → Supabase email confirmation → profile auto-created via `handle_new_user()` trigger |
| **Sign In** | `auth.signIn()` → email + password |
| **Forgot Password** | `auth.resetPassword()` → email with `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` → `spendnote-reset-password.html` |
| **Reset Password** | `auth.updatePassword()` on the reset page after OTP/code exchange |
| **Sign Out** | `auth.signOut()` → clears sessionStorage, localStorage keys, redirects to `index.html` |
| **Delete Account** | `auth.deleteAccount()` → Edge Function with role-based cascading |

### 3.2 Auth Guard (`auth-guard.js`)
- Included on all app pages
- Checks `supabaseClient.auth.getSession()`
- Receipt templates skip auth for `?publicToken` or `?demo=1`
- Iframes use bootstrap session from `localStorage` (`spendnote.session.bootstrap`)
- Supports `returnTo` parameter for post-login redirect
- Checks org selection state; redirects to `?orgPick=1` if multi-org user has no selection

### 3.3 Session Storage
- Uses **sessionStorage** (not localStorage) → session dies on tab close
- Bootstrap mechanism writes to `localStorage` for cross-tab receipt rendering
- Auth state changes trigger user cache + org context cache invalidation

## 6. Core Feature Flows

### 6.1 Cash Box Lifecycle
1. **Create**: `spendnote-cash-box-settings.html` → `db.cashBoxes.create()` → direct insert or RPC fallback
2. **Edit**: Same page in edit mode → `db.cashBoxes.update()` (currency + id_prefix locked)
3. **Delete**: Confirm dialog → deletes transactions → memberships → cash_box_access → cash box
4. **Reorder**: Drag-and-drop on list page → `sort_order` column update
5. **Settings**: Receipt visibility toggles, receipt label customization (Pro), cash box logo (Pro)

### 6.2 Transaction Lifecycle
1. **Create**: Dashboard modal or mobile page → contact getOrCreate → `spendnote_create_transaction` RPC
   - Receipt limit check (200 in preview mode)
   - Cash box snapshot auto-populated
   - Balance auto-updated via trigger
   - Sequence numbers assigned
2. **View**: Transaction detail page → receipt preview (A4, PDF, email, print-two-copies)
3. **Void**: `spendnote_void_transaction` RPC → creates reversal system transaction → balance corrected
4. **Filtering**: By cash box, date range, type, amount range, contact, created_by, transaction ID
5. **Sorting**: By date, amount, type, ID, cash box, contact, created_by

### 6.3 Contact Lifecycle
1. **Create**: Contact list page or auto-created via `getOrCreate` during transaction
2. **Edit**: Contact detail page
3. **Delete**: Single or bulk delete from list
4. **Snapshot**: Contact details snapshotted on transaction for receipt reproducibility

### 6.4 Team & Invite Flow
1. **Invite**: Owner/Admin → enter email + role → `spendnote_create_invite` RPC → `send-invite-email` Edge Function (Resend API)
2. **Accept**: Invitee signs up with `?inviteToken=` → `spendnote_accept_invite_v2` RPC → org_membership created
3. **Auto-accept**: On login, `spendnote_auto_accept_my_invites` matches pending invites by email
4. **Cash Box Access**: Admins get all cash boxes automatically; Users need explicit `cash_box_memberships` grants
5. **Role Change**: Owner/Admin can change user ↔ admin via dropdown
6. **Remove**: Delete org_membership or revoke pending invite

### 6.5 Account Deletion
1. **Frontend**: DELETE confirmation + 5-second countdown
2. **Edge Function** (`delete-account/index.ts`):
   - Verifies JWT
   - If owner: deletes all owned orgs (cascades to memberships)
   - Deletes auth user via `admin.deleteUser()` → cascades to profiles → cash_boxes → transactions etc.
   - `created_by_user_id` SET NULL, `created_by_user_name` preserved

### 6.6 Receipt System
- **Formats**: A4 PDF, Email HTML, Print Two Copies
- **Customization**: Per-cash-box visibility toggles (logo, addresses, tracking, additional, note, signatures)
- **Labels**: 9 customizable receipt text labels (Pro)
- **Logo**: Account logo + cash box logo with zoom/pan editor
- **Watermark**: Mandatory on dashboard modal preview
- **Session**: Receipt tabs use bootstrap session or postMessage for auth

### 6.7 User Settings
- **Profile**: Full name, company, phone, address, email (read-only)
- **Avatar**: Upload + zoom/pan editor, stored in localStorage + profiles table
- **Receipt Identity**: Display name, other ID, address — role-based editability
- **Account Logo**: Upload + zoom/pan editor — role-based control
- **Password**: Change current password
- **Delete Account**: Role-based warning text + DELETE confirmation + countdown
- **Billing**: Owner-only section (placeholder for Stripe integration)

## 7. Edge Functions

| Function | Trigger | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `send-invite-email` | Team invite flow | JWT + role check (owner/admin) | Sends invite email via Resend API with rate limiting |
| `delete-account` | User settings | JWT verification | Cascading account/org deletion with service_role key |

---

## 8. Security Measures

| Area | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **RLS** | All tables have Row Level Security enabled with per-user policies |
| **Auth Guard** | All app pages include `auth-guard.js` |
| **Session scope** | sessionStorage (tab-scoped) — no persistent login |
| **JWT verification** | Edge Functions verify caller JWT before any action |
| **Service role** | Only used server-side in Edge Functions, never exposed to client |
| **Rate limiting** | `spendnote_consume_rate_limit` RPC for invite emails (3/target, 12/caller per 10min) |
| **CORS** | Edge Functions return proper CORS headers |
| **Invite tokens** | Hashed with SHA-256 before storage; plaintext never persisted in DB |
| **Immutable fields** | Cash box currency + id_prefix locked via trigger after creation |
| **Error logging** | Client errors logged to `client_error_logs` table; Sentry integration (consent-gated) |
| **Cookie consent** | GDPR-aware banner with strict-mode for EU countries |
| **www redirect** | `www.spendnote.app` → `spendnote.app` canonical redirect |

---

## 9. Org Context & Multi-Org Support

- Users can belong to multiple orgs via `org_memberships`
- Org selection stored per-user in `localStorage` (`spendnote.selectedOrgByUser.v1.<userId>`)
- If multiple memberships and no selection → redirect to org picker on login
- All data queries (cash boxes, transactions, contacts) filter by `org_id`
- Dropdown in nav shows current org name, role, and user identity
- Team link in dropdown visible only for Owner/Admin

---

## 10. Identified Gaps & Recommendations

### 10.1 CRITICAL

| # | Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | **No RLS on `orgs` table in schema.sql** | The `orgs` table policies are managed via migration 025 but not in base schema — risk of drift | Add orgs table + policies to `database/schema.sql` |
| C2 | **`cash_boxes` RLS uses `user_id = auth.uid()`** | In org context, cash boxes belong to org owner's user_id, not the current user — Admin/User access works via `cash_box_memberships` + frontend org_id filter, but RLS itself only checks `user_id` | Consider RLS policies that also check `org_memberships` for org-aware access |
| C3 | **`contacts` RLS uses `user_id = auth.uid()`** | Same issue — contacts created by org owner are only readable by owner via RLS; team members likely rely on org_id filtering at application layer | Add org-aware RLS policies for contacts |
| C4 | **`transactions` RLS uses `user_id = auth.uid()`** | Same pattern — team members can only see transactions where `user_id` matches, which may be the owner's ID | Add org-aware RLS policies for transactions |

### 10.2 HIGH

| # | Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | **No email verification enforcement** | Users can sign up without confirming email; Supabase may or may not have confirmation enabled | Verify Supabase project has email confirmation enabled; add UI feedback for unverified users |
| H2 | **No password strength validation** | Neither signup nor password change enforces complexity rules | Add client-side password strength indicator + minimum requirements |
| H3 | **Cash box delete is client-side cascading** | `db.cashBoxes.delete()` manually deletes transactions → memberships → access → box in sequence — partial failure possible | Move to server-side RPC or rely on DB CASCADE constraints |
| H4 | **No audit trail** | No log of who changed what (role changes, cash box edits, member removal) | Add an `audit_log` table for critical actions |
| H5 | **Void has no role restriction** | Any user with transaction access can void — no confirmation of who voided | Add role check (Owner/Admin) for voiding or at minimum log the voider |
| H6 | **User role can create/delete contacts but schema RLS only allows `user_id = auth.uid()`** | If contacts are created under org owner's ID, the "User" role member won't be able to edit/delete them via RLS | Ensure contacts are created with correct user_id or add org-aware policies |

### 10.3 MEDIUM

| # | Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| M1 | **No onboarding flow** | New user lands on empty dashboard with no guidance | Add first-run wizard or empty-state CTAs |
| M2 | ~~No transaction edit~~ | **By design.** Transactions are immutable; only void is allowed. | RESOLVED — no action needed |
| M3 | ~~No transaction delete~~ | **By design.** Only void is allowed. Dead `transactions.delete()` API method removed. | RESOLVED — dead code removed |
| M4 | ~~No export/download~~ | **Already implemented.** CSV + PDF export available in transaction history (selected + filtered). | RESOLVED |
| M5 | ~~No search on contacts page~~ | **Already implemented.** Search input + cash box filter + A–Z letter filter on contact list. | RESOLVED |
| M6 | ~~Receipt limit hardcoded to 200~~ | **Deferred to subscription/billing (S1–S3).** Preview client-side limit is sufficient. | RESOLVED — merged into subscription scope |
| M7 | ~~No cash box archive~~ | **Rejected.** No archiving; cash boxes are active or deleted. `is_active` column dropped. | RESOLVED — column removed |
| M8 | ~~Profile email is read-only~~ | **Rejected.** Users can delete account and re-register. Not needed. | RESOLVED — not implementing |
| M9 | **No 2FA/MFA support** | Only email+password authentication | Consider adding TOTP or Supabase MFA |
| M10 | **`team_members` + `cash_box_access` tables are legacy** | Frontend uses `org_memberships` + `cash_box_memberships` but old tables still exist in schema | Remove or mark deprecated; clean up schema.sql |

### 10.4 LOW

| # | Gap | Impact | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | **No dark mode** | App only has light theme | Add dark mode CSS variables + toggle |
| L2 | **No i18n** | All strings hardcoded in English | Extract to i18n files if multi-language is planned |
| L3 | **No offline support** | App requires connectivity for all operations | Consider service worker for basic offline read |
| L4 | **No notification system** | No in-app or push notifications (e.g., new team member joined) | Add notification center |
| L5 | **FAQ page has old version** | `spendnote-faq-old.html` still exists | Remove or redirect |
| L6 | **Sentry DSN in client code** | DSN is public (expected) but no environment filtering beyond localhost check | Add environment tag to Sentry init |
| L7 | **No pagination on contact list** | All contacts loaded at once | Add pagination for large contact sets |

## 13. Summary

SpendNote is a **cash management SaaS** with receipt generation, team collaboration, and role-based access. The application is functionally complete for its core workflows (cash boxes, transactions, contacts, receipts, team management, account lifecycle). The main areas needing attention are:

1. **RLS policy gaps** for org-aware multi-user access (Critical)
2. **Missing server-side enforcement** for receipt limits and cash box deletion (High)
3. **No onboarding, export, or transaction editing** (Medium UX gaps)
4. **Billing/subscription integration** not yet built (excluded from this audit)

The codebase is well-structured with clear separation between data, UI, and auth layers. The migration history shows systematic evolution. The Edge Functions are properly secured with JWT verification and rate limiting.
